# Prediction-Model-Using-Time-Series-and-Forecast-Algorithms
This is a prediction model that predicts the future values of the particular parameter based on the history of the parameter in the dataset used.
In this project, the parameter chosen is birth rate. The predictor is able to make a prediction based on the previous data about the future rates. 
This is programmed using R programming language.
